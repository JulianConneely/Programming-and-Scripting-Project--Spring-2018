*This repository contains Python code\
*Download Anaconda here https://www.anaconda.com/download/ to run these exercises\
*I recommend you run these scripts in Visual Studio Code


# Project Plan
Incremental tasks checklist to be completed on the way to project completion
- [x] Research background information about the data set and write a summary of it
- [ ] Keep a list of references used in completing the project
- [ ] Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it
- [ ] Summarise the data set using a Python script e.g. calculating the maximum, minimum and
mean of each column of the data set
- [ ] Write a summary of investigations
- [ ] Include supporting tables and graphics as necessary


# Background and Summary of the Data Set
The Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper *'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis'.* [1]

Multivariate analysis (MVA) is based on the statistical principle of multivariate statistics, which involves observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time. In design and analysis, the technique is used to perform trade studies across multiple dimensions while taking into account the effects of all variables on the responses of interest. [2].

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. [1]
